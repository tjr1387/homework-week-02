            <!-- these 'page links' will jump down to the 'about me', 'work', and 'contact me' sections of the page-->
            <!-- there is one more link on the mock-up that says 'resume' but theres no section ON the page.. maybe this links to a external file/page -- but for now itll be a dummy one -->
                <!-- these 'links' are just an 'href' to the ID of the sections -->
        <!-- then, rpobly still here in the header, a picture backgrounded subtitle (h2) -->

    <main>
        <!-- first section 'about me' (probly an h3, tho maybe h2?) with a simple 'p' tag write up -->

        <!-- 2nd section (the biggest piece) is 'work' with one BIG picture (acts as a link to an external site) -->
            <!-- below that, 4 smaller picture-backgrounded links which would point to other small projects (again, external live sites) -->

        <!-- 3rd (last section is a 'contact' with a number, email, github, and say 2 other things, like twitter/spotify -- tho maybe ill do my speedrun profile or something) -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- there is no footer in the mock-up, unless that last 'contact' section IS one -- its styled parallel to the other sections though, which lead me to think it should be in the main body -->
        <!-- so unless i decide to put that last section in the footer, ill make up some veyr small pointless one -->
    </footer>
