                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> I was born in Canada, about an hour west of Vancouver, B.C. My father was a Boston sports fan, and I grew to become one also. In 1996, he took a job interview in Massachusetts and was offered the position. <br>
                    <br>
                    Growing up I was a relatively serious gymnast -- doing it through high school graduation. I attended William and Mary; after a few years there, I quit gymnastics on top of dropping out -- moving back up to New England to do what college dropouts in niche sports wind up doing -- coaching that sport. I spent roughly 12 years coaching gymnastics, knowing that eventually I would need to do something else if I ever wanted to own a house or have a family. I am now working towards becoming a credible web developer. Fingers crossed!
